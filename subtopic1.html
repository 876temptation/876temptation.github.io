  <h2>History of Web Servers</h2>
  <p>Web servers have evolved alongside the web itself. The first web server and browser were created by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, demonstrating the concept of networked hypertext document retrieval. As the web grew, more robust and specialized web server software was developed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apache HTTP Server</strong>: Released in the mid-1990s, it became the de facto standard due to its modular architecture.</li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft IIS</strong>: Dominated enterprise environments on Windows servers.</li>
    <li><strong>NGINX</strong>: Introduced a high-performance, event-driven architecture suitable for high concurrency scenarios.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Basics of How Web Servers Work</h2>
  <p>A web server mainly listens on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS), accepting incoming requests, resolving resources (files or handlers), and returning responses. The core request-response loop involves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Listening for incoming network connections</li>
    <li>Mapping requests to resources</li>
    <li>Sending back status, headers, and message body</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Modern web servers support advanced features such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>TLS encryption (HTTPS)</li>
    <li>Virtual hosting</li>
    <li>Caching and compression</li>
    <li>Proxy and load balancing functions</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Evolution of Major Web Servers</h2>
<p>Early web servers like <strong>NCSA HTTPd</strong> laid the groundwork for modern hosting. 
The <strong>Apache HTTP Server</strong>, released in 1995, quickly became dominant thanks to its 
open-source model and modular design. <strong>Microsoft IIS</strong> gained traction in enterprise 
environments by integrating tightly with Windows systems. Later, <strong>NGINX</strong> emerged 
to solve the “C10k problem,” offering event-driven architecture that could handle thousands 
of simultaneous connections efficiently.</p>
