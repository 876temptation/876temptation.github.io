  <h2>Current Web Server Technologies</h2>
  <p>Today, web servers include popular open-source solutions such as Apache, NGINX, LiteSpeed, and Caddy. Cloud providers also offer managed web hosting, load balancers, and CDN services (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS, Azure).</p>

  <h2>Operational Concerns</h2>
  <p>Performance metrics such as requests per second, latency, and throughput are crucial for efficiency. Techniques like caching, TLS offloading, and HTTP/2 multiplexing improve performance. Security measures include HTTPS enforcement, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and DDoS protection.</p>
