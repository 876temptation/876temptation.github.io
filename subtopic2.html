  <h2>Current Web Server Technologies</h2>
  <p>Today, web servers include popular open-source solutions such as Apache, NGINX, LiteSpeed, and Caddy. Cloud providers also offer managed web hosting, load balancers, and CDN services (e.g., Cloudflare, AWS, Azure).</p>

  <h2>Operational Concerns</h2>
  <p>Performance metrics such as requests per second, latency, and throughput are crucial for efficiency. Techniques like caching, TLS offloading, and HTTP/2 multiplexing improve performance. Security measures include HTTPS enforcement, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and DDoS protection.</p>

  <h2
  
  <h2>Role of Cloud Hosting and CDNs</h2>
    <p>Modern websites rarely rely on a single physical server. Instead, they use 
    <strong>cloud hosting</strong> platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, which provide 
    scalable infrastructure and managed services. To improve speed and reliability, 
    many sites integrate <strong>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</strong> such as Cloudflare, 
    Akamai, and Amazon CloudFront. CDNs distribute content across global servers, 
    ensuring faster load times and reduced latency for users worldwide.</p>

    <p>In 2025, the CDN market is valued at over <strong>$26 billion</strong> and projected to 
    grow rapidly as streaming, gaming, and e-commerce expand. This trend highlights 
    how performance and security are now inseparable from web server technology.</p>
